# Data Exploration and Price Prediction on Airbnb data
## Introduction

Since its founding, Airbnb has hosted over 60 million people in 34,000 cities across the world and is continuing to grow quickly. Airbnb provides a convenient source of income for people who have otherwise vacant space and for guests looking for affordable and convenient housing options. With any service, trying to monitor and understand the underlying pricing dynamics of the Airbnb market is very important both for hosts and guests. As users continue to grow on both the supply and demand side, homeowners may find it hard to properly price their property. Airbnb has recognized this and conducted considerable research into suggesting pricing from a supply side standpoint.

## Purpose

The aim of this project is to predict the prices of airbnb listings based on the various factors like location, number of bedrooms, neighbourhood, etc.
